      <h1>About Jen</h1>
      <p class="indent">Welcome! My name is Jen Beck and I am a family therapist licensed by the state of Oregon (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist #T1692 and a Licensed Professional Counselor #C5111).  I completed my masterâ€™s degree in Couples &amp; Family Therapy from the University of Oregon and worked at Eugene Therapy prior to opening up my own practice.  For the two decades prior to becoming a therapist, I served as a coach at the collegiate level at Division I institutions across the county.  Seeing the value of my work counseling athletes to reach their highest potential on and off the field was what pushed me to become a therapist.</p>

<p class="indent">In my Eugene, Oregon private practice, I enjoy working with couples, families, individuals and a variety of relationship/team dynamics, whether it be navigating life milestones like children heading off to college, adjusting to becoming parents, other major life transitions or issues related to your family of origin.  I specialize in anxiety, depression, gender identity, grief and loss, personal growth, leadership, trauma and self-worth development.</p>
