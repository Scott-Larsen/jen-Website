<h3>Initial Consultation:</h3>
        
<p class="indent">I begin all new client relationships with a complementary 15-minute consultation to discuss your hopes, needs and for us to mutually assess our therapeutic fit.  This is also an opportunity for you to learn about my practice, my approach and discuss your journey.

        <h3>Insurance:</h3>

<p class="indent">I am in-network for the following insurance providers:</p>

<ul class="educationhistory">
<li>Pacific Source</li>
<li>Moda</li>
<li>Blue Cross Blue Shield (Regence)</li>
<li>First Choice Health Network</li>

<p class="indent">If you have other insurance carriers, I can continue to work with you as an out-of-network provider or on a private pay agreement.  I am happy to work with you and your insurer to guide you on what coverage is available to you. However, you will be responsible for the specifics of your personal plan.</p>
