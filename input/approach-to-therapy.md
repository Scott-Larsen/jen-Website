<p class="indent">Change is not easy and prioritizing your mental health is a courageous and vulnerable first step.  Building a trusting, supportive and safe relationship is crucial for the therapeutic relationship.  I find that it is worth investing in your emotional intelligence, building tools to empower you, setting boundaries and exploring your personal growth to reveal your full potential.</p>

<p class="indent">Together, we will uncover your strengths, strategize solutions and support your movement past the day-to-day struggles you are facing in your life and in your relationships.  I will offer a non-judgmental, warm, honest and empowering approach so we can collaboratively explore your goals, actively heal, articulate your needs and create movement toward wellness in your life.  I strive to practice from an inclusive stance with a social justice and antiracist perspective as well as to honor individuals as they identify as their authentic selves.</p>
